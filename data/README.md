# Monoclonal Antibodies RWE Data

Copyright 2022 The MITRE Corporation

Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 22-1741.

The toy dataset included in this repository is provided for example purposes only and does not contain any actual health system data. The dataset was derived from a data model very similar to the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/). 

## Data Requirements
This toy dataset ( [mab_pt_effect.csv](mab_pt_effect.csv) ) may be used to run and test the pipeline. This dataset was synthetically generated based on the actual study data, and therefore may contain logical inconsistencies; it has, however, been scrubbed of any potentially identifying information including geographic indicators. While this dataset may be used to run the pipeline, the results are not meaningful and should not be used in any way to derive conclusions about the effectiveness of mAbs. Please also note that because data was synthetically generated for this repository, running the pipeline with the toy dataset may produce warning messages in the log output.

To run this pipeline on an institution's data, replace the toy dataset with a similarly structured csv file. Ensure the columns and datatypes align with those included in the toy dataset.

*NOTE: It is the responsibility of the user to [de-identify the dataset](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html) prior to using this analysis pipeline, and to obtain appropriate* *Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval if required. It is recommended to hash the person_id column to limit potential privacy concerns.*
